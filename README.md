# Tic-Tac-Toe
Basic project implementing concepts of data structures and algorithms

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two player game. The one I have created allows two players to play it simultaneously in the output terminal. The game displays a 3X3 board and the player enter the coordintes of the box to make his/her move. Afterr the move is done the player turn is changed automatically and the first one to get a continuous streak of X or O ( vertically/ horizontally/ diagonally) wins the game.
